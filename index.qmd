With a year of hands-on experience as a Business Analyst, I have honed my skills in crafting robust and efficient solutions. My journey has been marked by a deep passion for continuous learning and a commitment to building responsive, user-friendly interfaces.

Proficient in Microsoft Excel, Power BI, Python, and R, I leverage these tools to analyze data and develop insights that drive informed decisions. My background in software development and analysis has equipped me with a solid foundation in problem-solving and innovative thinking, which I am excited to apply to new opportunities in Analyst roles.

I am actively seeking to transition into an Analyst position where I can combine my technical expertise with my analytical skills to contribute to impactful projects and drive business success.
